        <h2>Dimension Reduction</h2>
        <p>We hypothesized that features that contribute to the most variability within the data also best explain our outcome of interest. To test this hypothesis, we performed principal component analysis (PCA).</p>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>In our principal component analysis, the first principal component explains about a third of the variability we see in our features (35.6%), while the second to sixth principal component all explain between 5 to 10%. Together, the first three components cover over 50% of the variation we see in our data. Plotting the top 3 PCs and coloring the points by finish percentile (Figures 1-3 on the right), we see that higher values on PC 1 correspond to higher win place percentages. As hypothesized, the largest variability we see in our features also appears to be predictive of our outcome variable. </p>
          <p> From the visualization of each feature's contribution to the first two principal components (Figure 4), we conclude that there are two primary dimensions along which our observations vary in terms of their features. The first dimension relates to player actions, specifically how much damage you dealt to other players. The second dimension relates to match characteristics representing the total number of players. From a player perspective, we are much more interested in the first principal component, since how you play is something within your control, while the number of opponents you are facing is not.  </p>

          <h2>Identifying Successful Playstyles </h2>
          <p> In our data set, we were hoping to identify which playstyles lead to the greatest chance of winning. Since the probability of winning increases as the number of players decrease, it is to the players' advantage to eliminate players. Thus, we can hypothesize that successful players may take two approaches to the game:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> <b> Aggressive Strategy</b>: Players drop in a populated location and attempt to take control of the location. This is a high-risk and high-reward strategy as players are more likely to die early in the game due to an increased number of encounters but are rewarded with superior weapons and boosts. </li>
            <li> <b>Passive Strategy</b>: Rather than eliminating other players yourself, the passive strategy relies on surviving until other players have been eliminated. This typically involves hiding to minimize encounters until only a few players remain, then selectively taking fights until the player is the only one remaining.</li>
          </ol>
          <p> We first attempted to identify these strategies in our data by looking at the distribution of the percentage of total players killed by winners, as shown below.  </p>
          <img src = "../img/winners_killed.png" alt = "winners" class="center">
          <p> We were unable to identify clusters of different playing strategies among winners, due to the limitations of the data we have. However, our data analysis indicates that aggressive players who have more kills relative to other players do perform better on average.  </p>

          <h2>Limitations </h2>
          <p> Our data analysis has a number of limitations. The first is that for computational purposes, we only used around 20% of the total amount of solo-player data. In the future, we could consider repeating the analysis with a larger data set. Second, we only examined solo player data, so our conclusions are not generalizable to group gameplay, which is complicated by aspects of teamwork such as revival and positioning. </p>
