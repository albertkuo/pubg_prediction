Of importance is to identify the limitations within our analysis and what could be done in the future to address such limitations.

## Limitations
Our data analysis has a number of limitations. The first is that for computational purposes, we only used around 20% of the total amount of solo-player data. In the future, we could consider repeating the analysis with a larger data set. Second, we only examined solo player data, so our conclusions are not generalizable to group gameplay, which is complicated by aspects of teamwork such as revival and positioning.  

We were unable to identify clusters of different playing strategies among winners, due to the limitations of the data we have. However, our data analysis indicates that aggressive players who have more kills relative to other players do perform better on average.
