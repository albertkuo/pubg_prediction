# Data

The data comes from a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction). We are given a training set and a test set.

```{r import_data}
# Run download_data.sh to download the data
# Warning: Very large datasets. Read 1000 samples.
train = read_csv("data/train_V2.csv.zip", n_max = 1000)
test = read_csv("data/test_V2.csv.zip", n_max = 1000)
```

## Variables

Each row in the data contains one player's post-game stats. A description of the data fields is provided in the `pubg_codebook.csv`. 

```{r}
